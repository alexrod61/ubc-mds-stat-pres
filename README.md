# Teaching Strategy and Practice Presentation for the Position of [Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/assistant-professor-teaching-mdsstat)

This repository contains the materials corresponding to the teaching strategy and practice presentation. They are part of my application for the Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT position. The contents are briefly explained as follows:

- **Teaching Practice (30 minutes):** This sample lecture corresponds to topics taught in [Regression I (DSCI 561)](https://ubc-mds.github.io/course-descriptions/DSCI_561_regr-1/). The main topic of the lecture is **estimation in the context of linear regression** via ordinary least-squares. Its format is a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/blob/master/teaching-practice/OLS_estimation_teaching_practice.ipynb) with the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) extension to turn it into a live reveal.js-based presentation.
- **Teaching Strategy (20 minutes):** A presentation on the planned strategy to teach the above main topic. This sample lecture outlines student engagement and learning, assessment, technology, and difficulties students might encounter. Its format is a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/blob/master/teaching-strategy/OLS_estimation_teaching_strategy.ipynb) with the RISE extension.
- **Data Science Education Vision (15 minutes):** A presentation of my vision for Data Science education for undergraduate and professional graduate programs. Its format is a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/tree/master/DS-education-vision) with the RISE extension.
- **Lab Assignment Question:** A practicum on **estimation in the context of linear regression** via ordinary least-squares as an [`R` markdown](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/blob/master/lab-assignment/solution-key/OLS_estimation.Rmd) and its [PDF](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/blob/master/lab-assignment/solution-key/OLS_estimation.pdf). The [handout](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-pres/blob/master/lab-assignment/student-handout/student/OLS_estimation.Rmd) incorporates auto-graded items as instantaneous feedback. These items are built using [Otter Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Moreover, the practicum is designed to be submitted to the online grading platform [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). The marking rubric is included in the solution key.
